# MLog
A library to log and monitor machine learning systems. It's built using the decorator design pattern to easily apply logging and specified function or methods of interest.

## Under construction

The logging is focused on logging and monitoring of batch predictions, ie. the logging is not ideal for real-time predictions.

Will be compatible with Pandas DataFrames, Numpy Arrays and PyTorch Tensors
