# MLog
A library to log and monitor machine learning systems. It's built using the decorator and typestates design patterns to easily apply logging and specified function or methods of interest.

The purpose of the library is to easily control and observe any data shift, as well as monitor I/O, CPU/GPU usage.

Remove boilerplate logging code to monitor input and output of a machine learning pipeline.

## Under construction

The logging is focused on batch predictions, ie. the logging is not ideal for real-time predictions.

Will be compatible with Pandas DataFrames, Numpy Arrays and PyTorch Tensors
